# ADNI Ongoing Research


Public health has always been a big concern in the world, the issue of mental health always grabs the attention of many organizations and educational firms. Dementia is one of the biggest mental illnesses among the elders, which not only affect the patient but the whole family. This research aims to address the prediction of Dementia of a person in his initial stage which can ease the diagnosis of the disease and might help in the reduction of the number of patients at a wider scale. Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) contains the data from longitudinal studies having their early life history, health status, sociodemographic and other different health-related constraints which can be used to develop patterns describing the development of dementia in an individual. Machine learning is capable of identifying these patterns and predict Dementia at an early stage. In Data Science, Deep Learning algorithms are advancing and able to produce better results than traditional machine learning algorithms but deficient in interpretability, this study proposes an approach to overcome this and successfully interprets deep learning model. Also, introducing an efficient model for dementia prediction achieving accuracy up to 86 %.
